THE STORY

I'm Camille Roux. I planned to do a lot of collab this year with fxhash artists I like, but it takes too much time (or maybe I like too much artists ü§£). Some days ago, I woke up with this idea in mind: "Hey! What if I make a collaboration with all the artists I like at once!". This is how the BRIDGE project was born.

Moreover, I love the mutual aid and solidarity between fxhash generative artists. The BRIDGE can be seen as a symbol of the link between us ‚ô•Ô∏è
